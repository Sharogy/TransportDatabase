# TransportDatabase

This is the second Python App I coded together with a classmate, Its main purpose is to organize the internal data of a Transport Company.
Data includes Employee info, OFfices info, Vehicle Info, Goods info etc.

The app makes direct connection to the database, unfortunately our "free" web mysql database has expired, therefore this app can no longer be run, as no Data is available.
